# Drnk

Welcome to Drnk, the project with no ambitions but to be a glorified timer + soundboard app.

If you're trying to sideload and don't know how:

```
be on a macbook
open terminal
git clone https://github.com/Caelink/drnk.git
open xcode, navigate to the folder you ran that command in (if you have no clue, hit cmd-shift-h in the finder window and it's probably there)
plug in your iPhone, try to build to your phone when it pops up
if it tells you you need to do something like pick a team or sign in as a developer, just make your apple ID into a developer account, then change the team to personal in xcode
```
